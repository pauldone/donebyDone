# donebyDone
The open site and Dockerfile for building the donebyDone website.

During a work meeting someone suggested that I should copyright might tagline when I get things done.

WHen I accomplish a task, my favorite reply is "done by Done" indicating that I completed it. Why not include in the tagline a URL that further reminder that I did it and link www.donebyDone.com the website.

Literally within 30 seconds I registered the website and that night created the site.

At the time I was teaching myself containerization and so I built this site within a Python-driven Docker container.
